simple Asteroids clone for the Arduboy

if you want to run it at a decent framerate, use my fork of the arduboy library or replace your Arduboy.cpp fillScreen() function with mine.

Controls : 
UP to move (no acceleration yet)
LEFT/RIGHT to aim
DOWN to warp
B(left) to pause/unpause
A(right) to shoot
